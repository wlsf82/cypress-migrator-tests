# Take aways

- Start simple and add (or remove) complexity on-demand
- Don't worry about duplicated code when you're starting. You can aways refactor it later
- Let the code communicate with you. If it's time to create an abstraction, it will scream that at you
- Let abstractions as close as possible to where they are used
- Write short commits that tell a story (from the moment the code was "born" until its current moment)
- Use aliases so you don't need to repeat selectors
- Make use JavaScript's power
- Be happy, and keep testing!
